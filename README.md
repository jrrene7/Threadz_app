# Technologies
I used strictly Ruby on Rails for this project. I wanted to showcase my ability with using Ruby and Rails this time around. I used user authentication for this application (B-crypt). I've implemented Amazon's Web Services while using 'Paperclip" as a gem file that allowed me to upload files to my application.

# Approach 
The General approach that I've taken was, I wanted to build something I felt comfortable building. This is was inspired by some of my friends who are some fashion enthusiast.


# Installation 
run Bundle Install in your command line.


# User stories
As a user, I want to sign up.
As a user, I want to create a virtual inventory of my closet.
As a user, I want to start putting together some outfits.
As a user, I want to name, edit outfits, leave comments.
As a user, I want to add notes on outfits (ex: date worn, when is the next laundry day).
As a user, I want to have a list of clothing that I plan to own, etc.

# Major Hurdles
Getting the relationships between the tables was a real challenge for me. I definitely feel like I understand how I should plan out my next project. AWS & Paperclip was really frustrating because it was my very first time experimenting with it. It took a lot of time just to figure out how to set up your files in order to use AWS.
